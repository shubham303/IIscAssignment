1) hooks:
    Hook package contains WeightFreezeHook class, which freezes weights of given list of parameters

2) Models:
    Models package contains NN classes,
    Model.py : Implementation of Resnet-18 for CIFAR-10
    pruned_model.py  : provides methods to return zero-pruned and freezed models
    utils.py : provides methods for computing cutoff weight for given prune percent


3) runner:
        runner package contains test_runner and train_runner methods


4) utils:
    dataloader.py  : provides methods to create a dataloader
    save_best.py : used to keep track of best model during training, also notifies trainer if loss has not decreased for
     after some fixed interval for early stopping

5) freeze_train.py  Task-5
    1) trains a freezed model as expected in task 5.


6) prune.py:  Task-3
    program computes accuracy of zero_pruned model for various prune percent.

7) test.py:
    generic code for testing model accuracy

8) train.py  Task-1:
    code for training model

9) train_pretrained :  Task-2
    creates a pretrained resnet-18 model and trains it on CIFAR-10 dataset

10)  zero_pruned_train.py : Task-4
     Code for training zero-pruned model
